The message is in Chinese:\n\n[cron:c4a4e488-d905-4b91-9848-8003c7991837 half-hour-reminder] 每30分钟提醒我：检查一下消息和任务\n\nThis translates to: \"Remind me every 30 minutes: Check messages and tasks\"\n\nLooking at the instructions:\n- This is a cron job trigger\n- Current time is provided\n- I should return my summary as plain text, which will be delivered automatically\n- If the task explicitly calls for messaging a specific external recipient, I should note who/where instead of sending myself\n\nThis appears to be a reminder notification system. The cron job is triggering and I need to help with the reminder to check messages and tasks.\n\nSince this is a cron-triggered task about reminders, I should:\n1. Acknowledge the reminder\n2. Help the user check their messages and tasks\n\nLet me think about what \"检查一下消息和任务\" means in this context:\n- Check messages - could mean unread messages, notifications, emails\n- Check tasks - could mean todo lists, project tasks, calendar items\n\nI should provide a helpful summary of what needs to be checked. Since this will be delivered automatically, I should keep it practical and useful.\n\nGiven that I'm in OpenClaw with access to various tools, I could potentially:\n- Check for unread messages if there's a messaging integration\n- Look at calendar for upcoming tasks/events\n- Check any task management systems\n\nHowever, I don't have direct access to the user's email or messaging accounts without more information. I should provide guidance on what to check or offer to help if they want to set up automated checks.\n\nActually, looking at the runtime info: channel=feishu, so this is being delivered to Feishu/Lark. The message will be delivered automatically to Feishu.\n\nLet me provide a helpful reminder response in Chinese since the original request was in Chinese.","thinkingSignature":"reasoning_content"},{"type":"text","text":"每30分钟提醒：检查一下消息和任务\n\n好的，这是你的半小时提醒！\n\n📬 **需要检查的内容：**\n\n1. **消息**\n   - Feishu 通知\n   - 邮箱未读邮件\n   - 其他聊天应用（如果需要）\n\n2. **任务**\n   - 今日待办事项\n   - 即将到来的日程安排\n   - 项目进度\n\n---\n\n🔔 **提示：** 如果你想让我帮你自动检查这些内容，可以配置具体的检查方式（比如集成邮箱、日历、任务管理工具等）。\n\n继续加油！ 💪"}],"api":"openai-completions","provider":"zai","model":"glm-4.7","usage":{"input":8961,"output":962,"cacheRead":5124,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":15047,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1772139505468}}
