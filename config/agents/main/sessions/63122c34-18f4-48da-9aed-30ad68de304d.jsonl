The current time is Thursday, February 26th, 2026 at 10:28 AM UTC.\n\nAccording to the cron message, this is a reminder to check messages and tasks. I need to return a summary as plain text that will be delivered automatically.\n\nSince this is a cron job reminder, I should provide a concise reminder message. The message should be in Chinese since the cron task description is in Chinese (\"每30分钟提醒我：检查一下消息和任务\").\n\nLet me check if there are any specific files I should read first. According to AGENTS.md, before doing anything else I should:\n1. Read SOUL.md\n2. Read USER.md\n3. Read memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md (today + yesterday)\n4. If in MAIN SESSION, also read MEMORY.md\n\nHowever, this is a cron job that's running independently, not the main session with the user directly. I need to check whether this is a main session or not.\n\nLooking at the Runtime info:\n- Runtime: agent=main | host=1c1b57c06abe | repo=/home/node/.openclaw/workspace | os=Linux 6.12.69-linuxkit (arm64) | node=v22.22.0 | model=zai/glm-4.7 | default_model=zai/glm-4.7 | channel=feishu | capabilities=none | thinking=low\n\nThe channel is \"feishu\", which suggests this might be a shared context rather than a private main session. However, it says \"agent=main\" which could indicate it's the main agent.\n\nGiven the instructions say \"If in MAIN SESSION (direct chat with your human): Also read MEMORY.md\" and this appears to be a cron job reminder (automated task), I should probably be more conservative.\n\nLet me provide a simple reminder in Chinese since that's the language the user used for the cron task description.","thinkingSignature":"reasoning_content"},{"type":"text","text":"检查提醒：您有30分钟定时提醒检查消息和任务。\n\n当前时间：2026年2月26日 上午10:28 (UTC)"}],"api":"openai-completions","provider":"zai","model":"glm-4.7","usage":{"input":3936,"output":862,"cacheRead":10149,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":14947,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1772101705259}}
