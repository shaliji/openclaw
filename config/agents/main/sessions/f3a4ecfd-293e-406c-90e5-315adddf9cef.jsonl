According to the AGENTS.md guidance on heartbeats, I should:\n1. Check emails for urgent unread messages\n2. Check calendar for upcoming events in the next 24-48h\n3. Check mentions or notifications\n4. Possibly check weather if relevant\n\nHowever, I don't have access to email APIs, calendar APIs, or social media APIs directly. I do have access to:\n- message tool (for sending messages to channels)\n- web_search and web_fetch (for checking online content)\n- browser automation\n- Feishu-related tools\n- Various file and system tools\n\nSince this is a cron reminder to \"check messages and tasks\", let me think about what I can realistically check:\n\n1. **Messages**: I don't have direct access to check unread emails or social media mentions. However, I could potentially use the browser to check certain web-based email systems or social platforms if the user has configured those.\n\n2. **Tasks**: I don't have a task management system configured. I could check if there are any TODO files or project management documents in the workspace.\n\nGiven the current tooling and the fact that this is running on Feishu (channel=feishu), the most reasonable approach would be to:\n- Send a reminder message to the user on Feishu prompting them to check their messages and tasks\n- Perhaps offer to help them check specific things if they tell me where to look\n\nActually, looking at the instructions more carefully:\n\"Return your summary as plain text; it will be delivered automatically. If the task explicitly calls for messaging a specific external recipient, note who/where it should go instead of sending it yourself.\"\n\nThis means the cron system will deliver my reply automatically. \n\nI'll provide a straightforward reminder in Chinese, keeping the message concise and actionable. The key is to prompt the user to take initiative in checking their messages and tasks across different platforms they use regularly.\n\nMy approach will be simple: clear language, minimal words, and a direct call to action that encourages the user to do a quick review of their important communication and pending responsibilities.\n\nI'll focus on a gentle nudge that respects their existing workflows while offering light support if needed.","thinkingSignature":"reasoning_content"},{"type":"text","text":"每30分钟提醒：检查消息和任务 ✅\n\n**当前时间：** 2026年2月26日 18:58 (UTC)\n\n**快速检查清单：**\n- 📧 邮件：有紧急未读消息吗？\n- 📅 日历：未来24-48小时有重要事项吗？\n- 💬 消息：社交媒体/群组有提及吗？\n- ✅ 任务：待办事项有什么需要处理的？\n\n---\n\n需要我帮你检查特定平台吗？告诉我你的邮箱、任务管理系统或其他需要关注的地方，我可以协助查看。"}],"api":"openai-completions","provider":"zai","model":"glm-4.7","usage":{"input":8961,"output":1174,"cacheRead":5124,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":15259,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1772132305469}}
