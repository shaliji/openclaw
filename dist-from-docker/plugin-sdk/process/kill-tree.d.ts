 * Best-effort process-tree termination with graceful shutdown.
 * - Windows: use taskkill /T to include descendants. Sends SIGTERM-equivalent
 *   first (without /F), then force-kills if process survives.
 * - Unix: send SIGTERM to process group first, wait grace period, then SIGKILL.
 *
 * This gives child processes a chance to clean up (close connections, remove
 * temp files, terminate their own children) before being hard-killed.
